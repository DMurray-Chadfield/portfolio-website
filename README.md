# Dan's Portfolio Website

This is a website I am building in Kotlin, following *Pro Kotlin Webapps from Scratch* by August Lilleaas.
It is currently a just a pet project but will one day hopefully serve as a portfolio for any other coding projects I build.

## Installation

### Requirements
- jdk 11 or later
- gradle

The project uses gradle as its build system. Currently, to run just requires running the main clas. This can be done
using your IDE, or with gradle by running
```bash
./gradlew run
```
from the project root.
